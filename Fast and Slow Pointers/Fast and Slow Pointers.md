## Key Takeaways

* Often used to find patterns or structures in the data
## Does this solution fit the Problem?

* Linear data structures such as vectors, arrays, linked lists, or strings
* Cycle or intersection detection
* Finding start elements at a second quartile (middle of a list, middle of a linked list, second half of a string)
## Sample Problems

* Find the middle of a Linked List
* Detect a cycle in a Vector
* Symlink verification algorithm
	* Detects if a symlink created would cause a loop between other symlinks
* Compilers
	* Object-oriented structures tend to have cycles between various modules stored in separate files for easier maintenance and these dependencies can be cyclical. Think of inheritance.
